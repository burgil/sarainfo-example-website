## How to use?

use pnpm instead of npm but you don't have too, because it's way safer to use pnpm because it doesn't run `postinstall`

Get node: https://nodejs.org/en/download/current

Optionally get pnpm: https://pnpm.io/installation

or remove the p and just use npm if you really want too.. but it's not recommended!

```
pnpm install
or
npm install

pnpm dev
or
npm run dev
```

## How to deploy to a website?

```
pnpm build
npx wrangler pages deploy dist
>
https://sarainfo.pages.dev/
```

If you already published and you want to have a custom domain e.g. .com or change the temporary domain e.g. .pages.dev then you can delete the .wrangler and the node_modules folder or access dash.cloudflare.com and set up a domain there for free!
